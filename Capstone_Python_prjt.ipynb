SMTP is a delivery protocol only, so you can't actually retrieve email with it, you can only send email, which is what we'll be focusing on in this article. If you want to retrieve email instead, then you'll want to check out the IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol) protocol.\n",

SMTP is usually just provided as an outward-facing interface to their service via the smtp.gmail.com server. This is mostly meant to be used by email clients on your phone or computer (like Outlook, Thunderbird, etc).\n",

In this section, we'll focus on creating a plain, insecure connection (which should rarely, if ever, be used). This connection is unencrypted and defaults to port 25. However, the protocol for mail submission actually uses 587, which is what we'll use."
